# 🎮 AI-Powered Game Recommendation Engine

An intelligent web app that recommends video games based on your preferences or games you’ve already liked. Built with **sentence embeddings**, **ChromaDB vector search**, and an interactive **Streamlit** UI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Search by Preferences**: Enter a text description of your ideal game and get recommendations.
- 🎮 **Game-to-Game Recommendations**: Select games you’ve liked and get similar ones.
- 🤝 **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combines liked games + preferences for best match.
- 📊 **Semantic Matching**: Uses sentence-transformers + cosine similarity.
- ⚡ **Fast Retrieval**: Powered by ChromaDB vector store.
- 🎨 **Streamlit Interface**: Simple and interactive frontend.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Game descriptions are converted into embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
2. Embeddings + metadata are stored in ChromaDB.
3. User input is also embedded and compared for similarity.
4. The top matches are shown with confidence scores and game details.
